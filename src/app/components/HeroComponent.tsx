      Hi there, my name is Alain Cherubin and I am a Fullstack Software developer.I am passionate about Software development and eager to learn as much as I can. I first became interested in web development when i was intrigued by animations and features on websites.As I learned more about programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I became fascinated with the idea of creating beautiful, functional websites that could be accessed by anyone in the world.
