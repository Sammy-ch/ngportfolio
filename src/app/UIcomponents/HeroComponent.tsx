        Hey! my name is Alain and work primarily as a backend engineer. I&apos;ve worked with Java, Rust, Nodejs and other languages in designing backend systems that support seamless applications and building tools to enhance team efficiency. I’ve developed reliable APIs, managed databases and backend architectures. I work towards solving challenging problems and collaborating with diverse teams to deliver working solutions. In my free time, I dabble with graphics programming and embedded systems in zig.
